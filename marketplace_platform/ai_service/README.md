## Key variants

Models variants across the three architectures with comporable _GFLOPS_ were selected.
- There are several pytorch models & variants with slightly greater performance but computation is many magnitudes higher.

## XAI

</summary>

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| Grad-cam |  Visual heatmap of crucial image regions; what the "model is looking at". Made for CNNs. Optimal for image classification. |
| LIME | Local feature importance. Explanations may slightly differ for the same prediction. Lightweight | 
| SHAP |  Local (one prediction) or global (model-wide) feature importance. Consistent. Expensive for images. |

## Evaluation

</summary>

### Quantitative

| Metric | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | --- |
| Validation Loss | --- |
| Recall | Evaluate false negatives |
| F1 | Balance of precision and recall |
| Confusion Matrix | --- |
| AUC-ROC (Binary) | Measure of distinguishing difference |
